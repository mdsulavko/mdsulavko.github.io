However, this was 1000 hours before I even got into college. If I could show what I did to witcher 3 and some games on the gamecube, then I would be way more surprising.

				Since the 11th grade, I've been made to create simple programs. They are not good looking back, but they were fun to make. 
				<p>	
					1) CYOA Stanley Parable <br/>
					Starting from the very beginning when I only had just learned how html works, I created a choose you're own adventure surrounded the life of a person in the Stanley Parable video game except with a much less clever writer.
					<div> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_f8pWkL-gBrd3kwdlB2clkwcmc?usp=sharing"> Click here </a> to find the files and please select to download; index.html is the starting point file. </div> </a>
					Screen shot of a page of this program --> <a class = "important"> hover over here <div><img class = "screenS" src = "images/game1.png"/></div> </a> 
				</p>
				<p>
					2) Dota 2 Web Quest <br/>
					The project I was assigned to do was to create a web quest that would instruct the reader in the proper guidelines of my selected choice topic. I was heavily into Dota 2 at this point. I can not say this fully applies to Dota 2 anymore as the game has received several massive updates since I created this guide in late 2014. At this time I was a little capable of using minor css.
					<div> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_f8pWkL-gBrRjZjU0o5VkFBZnc?usp=sharing"> Click here </a> to find the files and please select to download; index.html is the starting point file. </div> </a>
					Screen shot of a page of this program --> <a class = "important"> hover over here <div><img class = "screenS" src = "images/game2.png"/></div> </a>
				</p>
				<p>
					3) Meal Card <br/>
					The point of this project was to demonstrate use of javascript to remember selections made in the html. I have finally managed to apply using the basics of the "getElementById" in javascript. However if you look at the code, you will be horrified by the inefficiency. This was the earliest stage of my understanding of javascript. The style I did this page in was a joke. I was trying to have fun with the assignments. 
					<div> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_f8pWkL-gBrRkt0MnVtN3ZIems?usp=sharing"> Click here </a> to find the files and please select to download; index.html is the starting point file. </div> </a>
					Screen shot of a page of this program --> <a class = "important"> hover over here <div><img class = "screenS" src = "images/game3.png"/></div> </a>
				</p>
				<p>
					4) Personal Quiz <br/>
					A tedious project given to demonstrate ability of using GET and POST. I transferred data such as name, and email address over html files in a quiz format. If you are to look at the extremely long url on the second page, you are able to see that your selections are recorded. 
					<div> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_f8pWkL-gBrdzVHYVAyOTQ0czg?usp=sharing"> Click here </a> to find the files and please select to download; index.html is the starting point file. </div> </a>
					Screen shot of a page of this program --> <a class = "important"> hover over here <div><img class = "screenS" src = "images/game4.png"/></div> </a>
				</p>
				<p>
					5) Safe Cracker <br/>
					A fun project of a game I developed following a specifications sheet given by my teacher. I used a lot of if statements in my javascript to make it run but it worked. I do remember messing up the final objective for the game, which is in my version you can not win. The win condition is to get jewels but instead I made a counter for each time you achieve the goal so in a way I made it that you can win multiple times per game.

					Screen shot of a page of this program --> <a class = "important"> hover over here <div><img class = "screenS" src = "images/game5.png"/></div> </a>
				</p>
				<p>
					6) Minesweeper <br/>
					The second most stressful piece of code I ever wrote was a very non-efficient minesweeper game. It lacked functionality the full game has, however the basic elements of the game are there. It is the most fun game to play. And by that I mean its the only game I ever made that I had fun playing.

				<span style = "color: red; font-weight: bold"> THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I LEARNED FROM TO ALL OF THIS </span><br/><br/>
				Save several backups of every file you create. Physical and cloud copies of a file can be deleted or vanish suddenly so several insurances are needed. I had already made a website that had used databases to save account data, was heavily styled with css, and was very detailed. I had two cloud copies online available, the most important one being on the web server website itself. All cloud copies were found to be deleted when I recently searched and all physical copies are early development stages. Having this project now would've been a big help but I didn't consider the chance of me using it again after I submitted it. <br/><br/>
